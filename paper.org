* Introduction
  Generating random numbers is an important problem in computer science and
  applied mathematics and in particular, in cryptography. Many cryptographic
  algorithms depend on the users' ability to generate random numbers including
  generating keys for one-time pads or testing primality via Miller-Rabin,
  Solovay-Strassen or the Fermat primality test. While sources of "true" random
  numbers exist, such as measuring atmospheric or thermal noise, these sources
  are limited in the amount of entropy they can provide and therefore bottleneck
  the speed of routines which make use of them [fn:2]. Thus most systems use
  "pseudo" random number generation which generate a seemingly random sequence
  of numbers that is "hard" to determine without knowing a secret key, or seed.
  Therefore finding methods of pseudo random number generation is of great
  interest to students of cyptography.

  
  Cryptography makes great use of the concept of the quadratic residue in a
  variety of applications. An integer q is a quadratic residue mod p if there is
  another integer x such that $x^{2}\equiv{}q \pmod{p}$ [fn:3]. To date, the
  distribution of quadratic residues and non-residues is an open problem, though
  several bounds concerning the number of quadratic residues have been
  developed. In 1918, Pólya and Vinogradov independently showed that
  $\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)$ for consecutive values of n can be seen as random
  coin flips with values of $\pm1$. In particular they showed on an interval of
  length N, the number of consecutive quadratic residues modulo p is
  $$\frac{1}{2}N+O\left(\sqrt{p}\log{p}\right)$$. Thus we can state
  $$\left|{\sum\limits_{n=M+1}^{M+N} {\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)}}\right| <
  \sqrt{p}\log{p}$$ which gives us a bound on the number of identical
  consecutive "coin tosses". 

  In the following short paper we will investigate
  how "random" this sequence is, how we can best compute these values and what
  other related bounds exist.

  - Not much is known about the distribution of quadratic residues and non
    residues from 1 to p-1 (mod p)[fn:1] 
  - Polya and Vinogradov independently showed that (n|p) on n = 1 - p-1 for
    large primes p is somewhat of a random sequnce 
    - specifically that the number of quad res mod q on an interval of length q
      is N/2 + O(\sqrt{p}log(p))

* Pólya-Vinogradov Inequality

  First we must evaluate what the Pólya-Vinogradov Inequality tells us. This
  inequality can be interpreted as a measure of the "statistical fluctuation" of
  the number of quadratic residues and non residues in the sequence of Legendre
  symbols on a prime p. In particular the inequality says
  that this count is bounded by $\sqrt{p}\log{p}$, though for p large, this
  becomes $\sqrt{p}$. In addition we know from the inequality that in an
  interval of length N, there are $$\frac{1}{2}N+O\left(\sqrt{p}\log{p}\right)$$ consecutive
  quadratic residues $\pmod p$. Thus we know the least quadratic
  non-residue $\pmod p$, is bounded above by $O(\sqrt{p}\log{p})$ [fn:4].

  Later, finer upper bounds were found, but they do not improve substantially
  upon Pólya-Vinogradov. In 1987 Cochrane obtained that
  $$\left|{\sum\limits_{n=M+1}^{M+N} {\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)}}\right| <
  \frac{4}{\pi{}^2}\sqrt{p}\log{p}+0.41\sqrt{p}+0.61 $$.

  Other bounds can be found if we assume certain facts about the distribution of
  primes. Notably, Montgomery and Vaughan (1977) showed that if we assume the
  truth of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis then the estimate of the character
  sum above becomes $O(\sqrt{p}\log{\log{p}})$ [fn:5] In addition, Schur (1918)
  provides a lower bound, $$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)\right|>\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt p$$

  These bounds are visualized in Figure [[fig:1]]. In the following paragraphs we will compare the real world results against
  these bounds. 
* Findings
** Computing Quadratic Residues
   The Legendre symbol is defined as[fn:6]: $$\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) =
   a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \pmod p =
   \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if } a \text{ is a quadratic residue modulo } p \text{ and } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p}, \\
   -1 & \text{ if } a \text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo } p, \\
    0 & \text{ if } a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.  
   \end{cases}$$ This indicates if we were to naively evaluate the sum in the
   Pólya-Vinogradov inequality, the sequence to be summed would be made up of 3
   values namely, 0, 1 and -1. This would require a modular exponentiation which
   are expensive. Obviously (and at the suggestion of the professor) this is not
   the direction to go first.

   Firstly when evaluating the sum we will choose a range from $1$ to $N$ for
   some $N > 1$. If we choose our $N$ to be $p-1$ then instead of calculating
   the Legendre symbol, we can directly find the quadratic residues in this
   range by squaring the numbers in the interval $\frac{p-1}{2}$ taken $\pmod
   p$. If our interval from $1$ to $N$ is smaller than $p$ we know there are no
   zeroes, thus all other values are $-1$. If this interval is larger than $p$,
   we leverage the fact that the Legendre symbol is periodic in p. Finding the
   quadratic residues is the same as before but we should then find the first
   integer in our interval, n such that $n|p$. We can then create an array the
   size of our interval, and place a zero at this index. After this index we can
   fill in the values $1^2...{\frac{p-1}{2}}^2, 0$ repeating until the array is
   filled.

   However, if we are taking some random interval in \(1 ...\) that doesn't contain
   an $n$ that divides $p$ then we can just directly calculate the Legendre
   symbol. To speed up our calculations we should not use the direct calculation
   using a modular exponentiation but instead use the supplements to the law of
   quadratic reciprocity like one would do when evaluating a Legendre symbol by
   hand. This means pulling off powers of 2 from $a$ in
   $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)$ then we have
   $\left(\frac{2^n}{p}\right)\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)$ and using the law of
   quadratic reciprocity to simplify our calculations. This is exactly what is
   done in Victor Shoup's NTL library.

   In the next section we will analyze the "randomness" of the sequence produced
   above. First we will cast our outcomes as "coin flips".
   Since we know we only have two outcomes, 1 or -1, we can map values of -1
   onto 0. Thus our program output pure binary data, without needing to deal
   with negatives. We can now quickly return blocks of coin flips.

   Note carefully that this sequence will repeat on p, thus if this algorithm
   were to be used as a pseudorandom number generator such as ~/dev/random~ on
   UNIX systems, then a new p should be found each time a 0 is reached in a
   sequence.

** Randomness of Sequence
   We've discussed how to implement a pseudorandom number generator using this
   inequality and implied that it is "random", but we should quantify the quality
   of our pseudorandom number generator. 

   There are many ways to measure randomness. Using the ~ent~, the "Pseudorandom
   Number Sequence Test Program", we can deduce several properties of a
   sequence easily. ~ent~ produces a measure of entropy, "the information
   density of the contents of the file" by attempting to compress the input.
   Next an arithmetic mean is produced. Since our sequence is made up of purely
   one's and zero's this should always be exactly 0.5. Next a monte carlo
   simulation estimating Pi is performed using our coin flips as input. This
   should yield a small error as the input grows. After this a serial
   correlation coefficient is found. For random sequences this should be 0,
   meaning terms cannot be predicted using the previous terms. Lastly, and most
   importantly a chi-square test is computed. This test is often used to measure
   randomness of data and is extremely sensitive. We will discuss this measure
   shortly.

   First the first several measures can be showcased. For 400 primes of 6-29
   bits, we produced:

   |-------------+----------+----------------+------------------------+--------------------------------|

   Thus primes over about 30-bits are needed the be random enough to calculate
   Pi using a monte carlo simulation. If we do not need cryptographically secure
   random bits, anything over about 14-bits primes are useful.

   Finally the Chi-square results. The Chi-Square results should be near 50%
   plus or minus a large percentage. For example, random numbers generated by
   radioactive decay had a 41% chance of being random. Here our pseudo random
   number generator gets outed for what it is -- pseudo random. The average case
   percentage is 99.943%. This puts our generator into what the ~ent~ website
   refers to as "almost certainly not random" range. However, we are in good
   company. For instance the rand() function from the C standard library is
   pegged at 99.99%.

   Why might this be? Here is where are bounds come back into play. While the
   legendre symbol outputs sequences that have many of the properties that are
   desirable of random numbers such as those in the table above, the legendre
   symbol is tends to have "runs" of 1s or -1s (0's in our
   implementation), as opposed to flipping back and forth. These "runs" can be
   described, albeit loosly, by the bounds we are investigating. This is in stark
   contrast to true random sequences which have no such bounds.

   This means while the legendre symbol is interesting for investigating the
   distribution of quadratic residues, and it is somewhat random, it will not do
   as a pseudo random number generator.

* Future Work
  In "On the Randomness of Legendre and Jacobi Sequences" Damgard (1998)
  suggests that Jacobi symbols generate stronger randomness properties than a
  Legendre sequence. This is worth exploring.
